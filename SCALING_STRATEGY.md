# ElaraV2 Scaling Strategy

## Current: GitHub Actions MVP ✅

**Perfect for validating the concept and early development.**

### Metrics to Watch:
- Episodes processed per month
- Average processing time
- User growth rate
- Processing failures

### Migration Triggers:
- Hitting 1,500 minutes/month usage (75% of free tier)
- Episodes taking >4 hours to process
- Need for real-time processing
- >50 active users

## Phase 2: Cloud Run Migration

### When to Migrate:
- 200+ episodes/month
- Need faster processing
- Want concurrent processing

### Implementation:
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for Cloud Run
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install dependencies
COPY scripts/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy processing script
COPY scripts/ /app/scripts/
WORKDIR /app

# Entry point
CMD ["python", "scripts/process_podcast.py"]
```

### Benefits:
- 60-minute timeout (vs 6 hours, but more realistic)
- Auto-scaling (0 to many instances)
- Pay per actual usage
- Concurrent processing
- Better monitoring

### Estimated Costs:
- ~$0.10-0.50 per episode processed
- No monthly minimums
- Pay only when processing

## Phase 3: Specialized AI Infrastructure

### Options:

#### Option A: Modal.com
```python
import modal

app = modal.App("elara-processing")

@app.function(
    image=modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install_from_requirements("requirements.txt"),
    gpu="A10G",  # Optimized for AI workloads
    timeout=3600
)
def process_podcast(url: str, episode_id: str):
    # Your existing processing logic
    pass
```

#### Option B: RunPod Serverless
- GPU-optimized for WhisperX
- Better pricing for AI workloads
- Built-in model caching

#### Option C: AWS Batch + GPU
- Most cost-effective at high scale
- Full control over infrastructure
- Complex setup but maximum flexibility

## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1 → Phase 2 (GitHub Actions → Cloud Run)
- [ ] Containerize processing script
- [ ] Set up Cloud Run service
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Update app to trigger Cloud Run instead of GitHub Actions
- [ ] Test with parallel processing
- [ ] Monitor costs and performance

### Phase 2 → Phase 3 (Cloud Run → Specialized)
- [ ] Evaluate processing volume (>1000 episodes/month)
- [ ] Compare costs across platforms
- [ ] Test GPU optimization benefits
- [ ] Implement model caching
- [ ] Set up production monitoring

## Cost Comparison

| Phase | Platform | Cost per Episode | Monthly Limit | Setup Complexity |
|-------|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| MVP | GitHub Actions | $0 | ~100 episodes | ⭐ Easy |
| Growth | Cloud Run | $0.20 | Unlimited | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| Scale | Modal/RunPod | $0.10 | Unlimited | ⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| Enterprise | AWS Batch | $0.05 | Unlimited | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Complex |

## Performance Comparison

| Platform | Processing Time | Concurrency | Cold Start |
|----------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| GitHub Actions | 20-30 min | 1 | 2-3 min |
| Cloud Run | 15-25 min | 100+ | 30 sec |
| Modal/RunPod | 10-15 min | 1000+ | 10 sec |
| Dedicated GPU | 5-10 min | Limited | None |

## Recommendation Timeline

### Months 1-3: GitHub Actions
- Focus on product development
- Validate user needs
- Process 50-100 test episodes

### Months 4-6: Evaluate Migration
- Monitor usage patterns
- Test Cloud Run implementation
- Prepare migration plan

### Months 7+: Scale Based on Metrics
- Migrate when hitting limitations
- Optimize for user experience
- Monitor costs and performance

## Key Metrics to Track

```sql
-- Episode processing metrics
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  COUNT(*) as episodes_processed,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - created_at))) as avg_processing_time,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN processing_status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failures
FROM episodes 
WHERE processing_status IN ('completed', 'failed')
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

This data will inform your migration decisions and help optimize costs.
